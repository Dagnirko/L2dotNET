## What is this?
L2dotNET is a server emulator for L2.
Current goal is to get all the basic functionality and the packet support fully working in order to move on to accurate game features implementation. 
Note that the files are based on some very basic implementation a russian guy did back in 2008 so if you see shit code (and you will see plenty of it) don't worry it will be replaced.

## Can i contribute?
Yes please. This is not something small. This will take a while before it is playable.
If you really want to profit by using the project one day, please fork it and do as many pull requests
as possible. As long as you use the coding style i am coding on, i will approve your pulls.
There is plenty of things to do for any level of developer.
